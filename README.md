# Biomedical-Signal-Processing-MATLAB
The predominant objective of this experiment is to implement DFT and IDFT and analyse biomedical signals using them.

The main points to understand about a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are:
1. The Discrete Fourier Transform of a time signal, if done "correctly," is simply a sampled version 
of the spectrum of the signal over some finite frequency range.
2. The Discrete Fourier Transform is very useful in computationally intensive filtering, 
convolution, or correlation applications where it is often more efficient to do calculations in the 
frequency domain instead of the time domain.
3. The Discrete Fourier Transform can be efficiently computed using a technique called a Fast 
Fourier Transform
